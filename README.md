This MERN stack app is designed for teams to create tasks, assign them to team members, and see their status.

#### Functionality and technologies:

- Full stack - the application has a front-end part, a server and a connected “MongoDB” database.
- Authentication - only team members with login data can access the system. After entering login data, a request is sent to the server and if the user exists, a "JWT token" is generated for him, which is used for further identification and authorization of the user in the application.
- Tasks - users can create and view tasks assigned to them, update the completion status.
- Users - in the application you can see the list of users, add new users, edit your profile data.
- Design - used Material UI v5 library to create professional design. The app can choose between a light or dark design mode.
